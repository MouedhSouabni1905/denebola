The user-end part of my system configuration I'm working on, which mixes both the usual way of ricing linux (ie. config files) for system-tied services like zsh, hyperland, quickshell, and the nix package manager for managing applications and their configuration declaratively. it might or might not work on your system, I haven't tested it anywhere yet as it is still incomplete.
